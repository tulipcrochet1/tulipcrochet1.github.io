There are multiple ways of installing Hydejack.
The easiest and cleanest way is [via the Starter Kit](#via-starter-kit).


## Via Starter Kit
Using the Starter Kit has the advantage of not cluttering your blog repository.
Additionally, it allows you to publish your site on GitHub Pages with a single `push`.

If you have a GitHub account, fork the [hy-starter-kit](https://github.com/hydecorp/hy-starter-kit) repository. Otherwise [download the source files][src] and unzip them somewhere on your machine.

**NOTE**: In addition to the docs here, you can follow the quick start guide in the Starter Kit.

`cd` into the directory where `_config.yml` is located and follow the steps in [Running locally](#running-locally).
